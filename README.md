# ft_containers

The `ft_containers` project is a C++ implementation of several container classes: `vector`, `map`, and `stack`. The project was developed as part of the curriculum for the 42 school.

Each container class is implemented from scratch, without using any pre-existing standard libraries. The implementation includes all the basic functionality of the container classes, such as adding and removing elements, iterating over the elements, and performing various operations on the elements.

The project includes a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation. The tests cover a wide range of use cases and edge cases to ensure that the container classes behave correctly in all scenarios.

The `ft_containers` project is a great opportunity to learn more about the internals of container classes and to improve your understanding of C++ programming. The project is also a great way to prepare for technical interviews, as knowledge of container classes is a common requirement for many programming positions.
